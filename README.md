# Kmeans
KMeans algorithm implemented for image segmentation. A way to view segmentation is clustering, where pixels sharing certain features such as color, intensity, or texture are grouped together and represented as a single entity

USED TECHNOLOGIES
- C++, OpenCV
- Used OpenCV classes to read and process images and define clusters
- Determine the histogram of an image and extract the main features of it
- Applied the algorithm on GrayScale and RGB images
- Used OpenCV functions to transform the RGB image in HSV channels
